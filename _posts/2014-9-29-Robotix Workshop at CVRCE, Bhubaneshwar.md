So right after the mid-semester examinations concluded, I had another big task at hand. [Technology Robotix Society](http://robotix.in/), a student-run society at IIT Kharagpur which I am a part of, conducts technical workshops at major cities throughout India. This year I had been allotted the Bhubaneshwar workshop. It was held at [C.V. Raman College of Engineering](www.cvrce.edu.in/) on 25th of September 2014. However, I just had a day to prepare for it. Addressing a crowd for 2 hours isn't something I have tried. Add to it the fact that I have never witnessed a Robotix workshop before. I did attend last year's Calcutta workshop, but I slept through it (that was probably due to a nightout). So, I was excited to say the least.  

The reception at CVRCE was amazing. Well, amazing would be an understatement. Even though I arrived minutes late the organizing team at CVRCE, Bijaylakshmi and Utsav, stuffed me at the canteen. The [Kshitij](http://ktj.in/) core-team member, Krishna, handled the workshop for the first 20 mins.  

The topics I had to talk about were pretty basic robotics stuff. It started from an introduction and moved on to locomotive systems, differential drives, motor drivers, sensors and ended with the line follower. I did witness some great questions from the junta, mostly pertaining to the electronic components that were mentioned in the slides. The presentation that was used for the workshop can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jkVV2tdF4Yhl_B9WbGjrGSQPHlxbPMUzQWx5I2UdYdI/edit?usp=sharing).
Most of the participants were chemical engineers and so I just couldn't dive into algorithmic coding and discuss about the online coding event, [Sudocode](http://www.robotix.in/events/event/sudocode).   

The best part of the workshop? It has to be being introduced as a "Robotics Expert".
